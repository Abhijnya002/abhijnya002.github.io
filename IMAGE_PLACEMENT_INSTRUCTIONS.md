# Image Placement Instructions

## BMS College of Engineering Logo
**Location:** `public/images/logos/bms-college.png`
- The logo image you provided should be saved as `bms-college.png` in the `public/images/logos/` folder
- The education section will automatically use this logo for BMS College of Engineering

## Medical Text NER Dashboard Image
**Location:** `public/images/projectTable/Medical Text NER.webp`
- The Healthcare NER Dashboard image you provided should be saved as `Medical Text NER.webp` in the `public/images/projectTable/` folder
- If you have a different format (PNG, JPG), you can convert it to WebP or update the projectImagePath in `src/data/portfolioData.js`

## Note
- The `projectTable` folder has been created automatically
- Make sure the BMS logo is in PNG format
- The Medical NER image should ideally be in WebP format for optimal performance, but PNG/JPG will also work
